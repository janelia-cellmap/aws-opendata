### Objective
Custom visualization of segmentation layers using the Neuroglancer Python API.
*  Setting up the python environment
*  Introduction to the neuroglancer Python API
*  Introduction to the S3FS library for filesystem-like access to S3 buckets.
* Use S3FS to infer the structure of the s3-hosted datasets
* Choose segmentation layers to visualize
* Use the Neuroglancer python API to generate a URL that will render to a scene with the desired segmentation layers.
